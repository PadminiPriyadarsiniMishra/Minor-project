# Minor-project
This is a minor project that I performed in college.
Problem statement:This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom. The objective is to develop a machine learning algorithm that will determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its features such as cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.
